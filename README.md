Tutorial on repositories.

Hi people,

My name is Carolin Hanna. I am new to github and just trying to get a good feel of this site. I like to program even when it stresses me out. I like the challenges that it presents. I am hoping to gain more knowledge on programming and enhance my math skills when it comes to the physics of games. However, I truly feel like practising the gameplay mechanics of games would be truly beneficial for me.

Kind Regards,
Carolin Hanna.
